# NEF - Final Evaluation: Advancing self-reliance among displacement-affected communities (ASRD) Project

This code is working based on four Python scripts (pongamia_PMF.py, pongamia_data_analysis.py, pongamia_data_preprocessing.py, pongamia_indicator.py)

The 'data_preprocessing.py' file handles data preprocessing tasks, including data anonymisation, and removing duplicates and missing values.

The 'pongamia_pipeline.py' file performs data analysis for this project. It creates statistics and visualisations for each indicator and social demographic.

The 'data_visualisation_extra.py' file creates more visualisation files for the final report.

Before running the data preprocessing script, please place the raw survey dataset in the "\data" folder.
Before running the data analysis script, please place the cleaned survey dataset in the "\data" folder.
